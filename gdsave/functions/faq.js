        "a": "Since the community votes on demon difficulties, their rating is constantly changing. Your save file bases the demon difficulty off of the last time you downloaded them, and it is very likely that some ratings changed since then. <u>Since new demon levels default to Hard, you may see more hard demons than usual.</u>",
